  Send me your location lets<br>
  Focus on communicating 'cause<br>
  I just need the time and place to come through<br>
  (A chance to come through)<br>
  Send me your location lets<br>
  Ride the vibrations<br>
  I don't need nothing else but you<br>
</p>
<p>
  At times I wonder why I fool with you<br>
  But this is new to me, this is new to you<br>
  Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you<br>
  Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't<br>
  Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged<br>
  To understand that things go a little bit <br>
  better when you plan it<br>
</p>
<p>
  So won't you send me, your location lets<br>
  Focus on communicating 'cause<br>
  I just need the time and place to come through<br>
  Send me your location lets<br>
  Ride the vibrations<br>
  I don't need nothing else but you<br>
</p>
<p>
  I don't wanna fall in love off of subtweets so<br>
  Let's keep personal<br>
  I got a lot of cool spots that we can go<br>
  Tell me what's the move and I got you<br>
  I'm only acting like this cuz I like you<br>
  Just give me the vibe to slide then<br>
  I might make you mine by the night<br>
